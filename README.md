# The COVID-19 Pandemic in the US by the Numbers

Welcome!  You have arrived at analysis of the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States in 2020, from its first case on January 22 to November 30. Since the end of 2019, the spread of the COVID-19 from Wuhan, China has brought with it a devastating toll on human lives and economies around the world today. Considering its unique and highly contagious nature compared to other viruses, it should come as no surprise that it continues to dominate worldwide news cycles amid the rush to develop and distribute an effective vaccine and save as many lives possible.

### Preparing our Data

Our data can be collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) files here. From the get-go, we should be aware that given the current news cycle in the US, the CDC's data is bound to change as we learn more about newly recorded cases and deaths from COVID-19. The data included in this project accounts for cases and deaths up to November 30.

### Process of Analysis

Once we have our data ready for analysis, we will start off with an overview of COVID-19's effect throughout the whole US. We can dissect this further by comparing figures accounting for the whole year with those recorded by month. In this manner, we can visualize any spikes in cases and deaths over time. 

To get a more in-depth look on COVID-19 however, we can go beyond our original inquiry by examining the virus's spread between the individual states. Using this approach, we will isolate which states were hit the hardest over time and deduce which ones may have responded better in dealing with the virus. This latter note can be addressed by observing the virus's fatality rate. For the course of this project, the fatality rate will be defined as the proportion of new deaths over new cases. Later, we will inspect monthly trends between the states, and thereby identify any spikes over the year. Furthermore, we will apply these trends to predict how the states will fare against COVID-19 at the turn of the new year.
